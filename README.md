## Team Members + Strengths
* Christopher Millan
  * Some of my strengths include being a good technical writer, able and willing to do monotonous, experimental tasks, and having a decent coding background. I generally find my ways around errors with a few Google searches, so I tend to grasp to new concepts fairly quickly. I would say I also have an eye for "things that look good" versus "things that don't", although don't ask me why it is because I might not be able to explain it myself.

## Team Members + Strengths
* Christopher Millan
  * Some of my strengths include being a good technical writer, able and willing to do monotonous, experimental tasks, and having a decent coding background. I generally find my ways around errors with a few Google searches, so I tend to grasp to new concepts fairly quickly. I would say I also have an eye for "things that look good" versus "things that don't", although don't ask me why it is because I might not be able to explain it myself.
* Natalie Herrmann
  * My strengths include being comfortable with coding, being persistent with diagnosing and figuring out errors, and following rubrics/specifications and keeping track of whether everything is being done as expected. I'm a stronger programmer than designer, and I work best when I know exactly how things should be done.
* Richard Fagan
  * I'm good at programming, designing, and testing, with preference to programming. I'm not good with colors. I think I'm also good at multi-tasking.
* Abdulaziz Aldossari
  * I'm good at designing, coding in HTML CSS JavaScript, and tracks errors. Also, I likes to suggest things like, for this project I suggest creating cars rent app. I'm not good at choosing or designing pictures for websites.

## Project Proposal
Our group will design a booking system for the purchase of movie tickets from a hypothetical local theater.
As such, the customer will be able to look up viewing availabilities for each movie, check a seating chart to reserve their spot(s), and purchase tickets. They will enter their name and a credit card to complete the purchase.

## Team Members
* Christopher Millan
* Natalie Herrmann
  * My strengths include being comfortable with coding, being persistent with diagnosing and figuring out errors, and following rubrics/specifications and keeping track of whether everything is being done as expected. I'm a stronger programmer than designer, and I work best when I know exactly how things should be done.
